#### Table Tennis
---
I love table tennis for its beauty of ultimate *power*, *speed*, and *spin*. 

My favoriate player is [Hao Wang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Hao_(table_tennis,_born_1983)). He is widely regarded as the world's best player of the Reverse Penhold Backhand (RPB, 直拍横打 in Chinese), a fantastic technique I'm currently learning! What impresses me most about him is that despite winning the Olympic silver medal three times, he has always kept the heart of a champion.

#### Anime
---
At my leisure, I enjoy savoring and sharing anime with friends. 

My favorites (top-5): *White Album 2*, *EVA*, *JoJo's Bizarre Adventure*, *K-On!*, and the *Disastrous Life of Saiki K*.
